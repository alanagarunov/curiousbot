# curiousbot
a discord bot made by the help of discord.py link https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

This bot is very simple, a simple descripition of all the bot does:
1. Upon the bots join, it will send a message to a specific channel in a server its in (you'll have to supply the channel id yourself) I have it to ping someone.
2. I have a simple game of eightball which you can invoke but using the bot_prefix which you can change.
3. A simple send message function that will send a message when someone invokes it with the bot_prefix and keyword. Notice in this version that i made a different bot_prefix hardwired in the command, this is because the bot in incredibly scuffed.
4. The entire thing is wrapped around a time loop so that it executes at a specific time.
